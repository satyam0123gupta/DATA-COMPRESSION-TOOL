## THIS IS ABOUT DATA COMPRESSION TOOL. WE HAVE TO WRITE  A PROGRAM TO IMPLEMENT A BASIC DATA COMPRESSION ALGORITHM LIKE RUN-LENGTH ENCODING (RLE).

## DELIVERABLE: A TOOL THAT COMPRESSES AND DECOMPRESSES TEXT FILES.

*IHAVE PREPARE THIS TASK IN DEV C++
* ✅ How to Compile & Run in Dev-C++:
*Open Dev-C++.*

*File > New > Source File.*

*TYPE THE CODE* 

*Save as rle_tool_dev.cpp.*

*Compile (F9). Run (Ctrl + F10).*

*Provide the input/output file names without quotes.

*🔎 Input File (input.txt)

*AAABBBCCCCDD*

*WE GET (Compressed Output:)
*3A3B4C2D*


▶️ 2. Run the Program in Dev-C++
When you run the program, it will ask:

RLE Compression Tool
1. Compress a file
2. Decompress a file
Enter your choice:
👉 If you want to compress:
Type 1 and press Enter.

Then it asks:
Enter input file name:
➡️ Type: input.txt and press Enter

Enter output (compressed) file name:
➡️ Type: compressed.txt and press Enter

Now it compresses the file, and a new file compressed.txt will be created in the same folder.

*🟢 If you want to decompress:
Run the program again.

Choose option 2.

*For input file, type compressed.txt.

*For output file, type something like decompressed.txt.

📁 Example File Names:

*Input Text :	input.txt

*Compressed File :	compressed.txt

*Decompressed File :	decompressed.txt





## AS OUTPUT RESULTS :

*INPUT FILE*
